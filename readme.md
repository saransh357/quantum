This generator utilizes the principles of quantum superposition and measurement to create highly random, secure passwords. It constructs a quantum circuit that initializes a set of qubits, applies Hadamard gates to create superposition, measures the qubits to obtain classical bit strings, and maps those bit strings to characters from a predefined alphabet.

The length of the password is probabilistically determined based on the qubit measurement outcomes, and characters are randomly selected to form the final password. For added complexity, the generator can replace certain characters with numbers. The result is a strong and unpredictable password, offering enhanced security.

The repository includes a quantum random number generator implemented with the Qiskit library. It defines two core functions: real_map and QRandom. The real_map function maps a value from one range to another, while the QRandom function generates a quantum random number. This function creates a quantum circuit, applies Hadamard gates, measures the qubits, and retrieves the statevector. The non-zero elements of the statevector are used to generate a random number, which is then mapped to the desired output range using the real_map function.
